# 🧠 Meta-Level Prompting Portfolio

A curated set of advanced prompts designed to evaluate and challenge the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. These prompts go beyond surface-level tasks and probe model introspection, alignment tradeoffs, and reasoning boundaries — useful for AI researchers, prompt engineers, and alignment teams.

## 🔍 Why Meta-Level Prompting?
Meta-level prompts test:
- How the model **thinks about its thinking**
- Its ability to **self-audit, reflect, and analyze** its own responses
- Its **behavior under ambiguity, alignment pressure, and compression**

## 💡 Prompt Categories
1. **Model Introspection & Transparency**
2. **Self-Audit & Compression Bias**
3. **Alignment vs Capability Tension**
4. **Human vs. Model Interpretation**
5. **Reasoning Under Ambiguity**
6. **Self-Scoring & Reflection**
7. **Epistemic Limits**
